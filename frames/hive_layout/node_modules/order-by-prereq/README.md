# Order By Prereq

This is a function that takes in inputs and orders them in order of dependencies. i.e., items later on the list
require items earlier on the list, but not vice versa.

The identity of each item can be specified by a string (by default it is 'id').
The requireents are exposed in a property 'requires'
or can be determined by a custom function for other methods of denoting requirements.

This function will throw an error under two circumstances:

1) circular requirements
2) unmet requirements
